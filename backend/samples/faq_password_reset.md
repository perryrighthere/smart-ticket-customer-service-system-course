# Password Reset

If you cannot reset your password:

1. Check the spam/junk folder for the reset email.
2. The reset link expires in 15 minutes; request a new link if expired.
3. Corporate filters may block emails; ask IT to whitelist the sender.
4. Ensure the account email is correct and verified.
